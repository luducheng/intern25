  abstract     = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

  abstract   = {The inner 0.1 AU around accreting T Tauri stars hold clues to many physical processes that characterize the early evolution of solar-type stars. The accretion-ejection connection takes place at least in part in this compact magnetized region around the central star, with the inner disk edge interacting with the star's magnetosphere, thus leading simultaneously to magnetically channeled accretion flows and to high-velocity winds and outflows. The magnetic star-disk interaction is thought to have strong implications for the angular momentum evolution of the central system, the inner structure of the disk, and possibly halting the migration of young planets close to the stellar surface. We review here the current status of magnetic field measurements in T Tauri stars, the recent modeling efforts of the magnetospheric accretion process, including both radiative transfer and multi-dimensional numerical simulations, and summarize current evidence supporting the concept of magnetically channeled accretion in young stars. We also discuss the limits of the models and highlight observational results that suggest the star-disk interaction is a highly dynamical and time-variable process in young stars.},

  abstract     = {The essential ingredients of nuclear astrophysics are the thermonuclear reactions which shape the life and death of stars and which are responsible for the synthesis of the chemical elements in the Universe. Deep underground in the Gran Sasso Laboratory the cross sections of the key reactions responsible for the hydrogen burning in stars have been measured with two accelerators of 50 and 400 kV voltage right down to the energies of astrophysical interest. As a matter of fact, the main advantage of the underground laboratory is the reduction of the background. Such a reduction has allowed, for the first time, to measure relevant cross sections at the Gamow energy. The qualifying features of underground nuclear astrophysics are exhaustively reviewed before discussing the current LUNA program which is mainly devoted to the study of the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and of the synthesis of the light elements in AGB stars and classical novae. The main results obtained during the study of reactions relevant to the Sun are also reviewed and their influence on our understanding of the properties of the neutrino, of the Sun and of the Universe itself is discussed. Finally, the future of LUNA during the next decade is outlined. It will be mainly focused on the study of the nuclear burning stages after hydrogen burning: helium and carbon burning. All this will be accomplished thanks to a new 3.5 MV accelerator able to deliver high current beams of proton, helium and carbon which will start running under Gran Sasso in 2019. In particular, we will discuss the first phase of the scientific case of the 3.5 MV accelerator focused on the study of 12C+12C and of the two reactions which generate free neutrons inside stars: 13C(α,n)16O and 22Ne(α,n)25Mg.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a method of computing the evolution of low mass stars from the main sequence to the helium flash. Many such computations are handicapped by the fact that the hydrogen burning shell source becomes very thin at a relatively early stage of evolution, and this means that either a very short time step is needed on the red giant branch, or else that some special method must be introduced. The present method has neither handicap: the same procedure is used whether there is a thin shell or not, and the time step can be chosen so that the overall structure of the star changes by a fixed small amount per step. About 100 or 150 steps are necessary to evolve a star to the helium flash. The basic features of the method are that the structure equations are solved using a non-Lagrangian mesh, so that a thin shell if it exists can move slowly through the mesh, even if it moves rapidly with respect to the mass coordinate; and that the composition and the mesh are solved simultaneously with the structure equations, giving greater stability and self-consistency. Although the work described here does not take account of convective mixing of composition, it is suggested that a simple generalization of the equations used here would give a reasonable treatment of both convective and semi-convective mixing, if they occur.},

The new computations include a more complete equation of state (EOS) with more grain species and updated optical constants. Grains are now explicitly included in thermal equilibrium in the EOS calculation, which allows for a much wider range of grain compositions to be accurately included than was previously the case. The inclusion of high-temperature condensates such as Al2O3 and CaTiO3 significantly affects the total opacity over a narrow range of temperatures before the appearance of the first silicate grains. The new opacity tables are tabulated for temperatures ranging from 30,000 to 500 K with gas densities from 10-4 to 10-19 g cm-3. Comparisons with previous Rosseland mean opacity calculations are discussed. At high temperatures, the agreement with OPAL and Opacity Project is quite good. Comparisons at lower temperatures are more divergent as a result of differences in molecular and grain physics included in different calculations. The computation of Planck mean opacities performed with the opacity sampling method is shown to require a very large number of opacity sampling wavelength points; previously published results obtained with fewer wavelength points are shown to be significantly in error. Methods for requesting or obtaining the new tables are provided.},

An automatic mesh refinement is designed to adjust the location of the grid points depending on the variation in the unknowns. Moreover, a grid point can be adjusted at any determined position. This allows an exact treatment of the problem, even when the first derivatives of the integration variables (M, R, P, T, L) are discontinuous. A robust optimization method allows the calculation of models matching the observed equatorial radius and gravitational moments. The numerical accuracy of the models calculated is found to be satisfactory even with a small number of mesh points (the relative accuracy is better than 10\textasciicircum -5\textasciicircum{} on all the variables with 100 mesh points). The whole precision of models of giant planets is limited by the accuracy of physical data.},

Updated OPAL Rosseland mean opacities are presented. The new results have incorporated improvements in the physics and numerical procedures as well as corrections.

In addition, the temperature and density range covered by the updated opacity tables has been extended. As before, the tables allow accurate interpolation in density and temperature as well as hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and metal mass fractions.

  abstract    = {Rotation has important consequences for stellar internal structure and evolution. The centrifugal force deforms the star and balances gravity, mimicking a lower mass star. Most importantly, meridional circulations and rotation-induced turbulence mixes chemical elements, extending the stellar lifetime and affecting age determinations, one of the most important problems in astrophysics. Lastly, the rotation-convection interaction generates magnetic fields. The associated activity has a determining influence on the survival of planetary atmospheres. Asteroseismic data from the space missions CoRoT and Kepler have shown that current 1D models of angular momentum transport in radiative zones (turbulent viscosity and meridional circulation) are not satisfactory. Other mechanisms must be active, such as internal gravity waves, magnetic fields, etc. All models proposed for these mechanisms are incomplete and must, in particular, account for 2D effects. The 1D description of rotation is usually justified by the fact that turbulence is much stronger horizontally than vertically in radiative zones, suppressing variations of angular velocity. This assumption may not be verified at near the rotation axis. Moreover, because internal gravity waves are generated at the base of convective envelopes, the Doppler shift experienced by these waves when they enter the radiative zone should depend on latitude. These waves are further filtered in the transition zone between the convective and radiative zones, a zone that has a strong differential rotation. This PhD is devoted to the implementation in a stellar evolution code of a simplified treatment of transport of angular momentum in 2D. This treatment is based on a deformation method that enables the computation of the 2D structure of the star, as well as the rotation-induced perturbations of the various fields. The transport of angular momentum is then treated in 2D, and will allow the further study of extra mechanisms of transport.},

  abstract     = {Context. Rotational splittings are currently measured for several main sequence stars and a large number of red giants with the space mission Kepler. This will provide stringent constraints on rotation profiles. Aims: Our aim is to obtain seismic constraints on the internal transport and surface loss of the angular momentum of oscillating solar-like stars. To this end, we study the evolution of rotational splittings from the pre-main sequence to the red-giant branch for stochastically excited oscillation modes. Methods: We modified the evolutionary code CESAM2K to take rotationally induced transport in radiative zones into account. Linear rotational splittings were computed for a sequence of 1.3 M⊙ models. Rotation profiles were derived from our evolutionary models and eigenfunctions from linear adiabatic oscillation calculations. Results: We find that transport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too high a core rotation rate for red-giant models compared with recent seismic observations. We discuss several uncertainties in the physical description of stars that could have an impact on the rotation profiles. For instance, we find that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability does not extract enough angular momentum from the core to account for the discrepancy. In contrast, an increase of the horizontal turbulent viscosity by 2 orders of magnitude is able to significantly decrease the central rotation rate on the red-giant branch. Conclusions: Our results indicate that it is possible that the prescription for the horizontal turbulent viscosity largely underestimates its actual value or else a mechanism not included in current stellar models of low mass stars is needed to slow down the rotation in the radiative core of red-giant stars.},

  abstract     = {We construct updated solar models with different sets of solar abundances, including the most recent determinations by Asplund et al. The latter work predicts a larger (∼10\%) solar metallicity compared to previous measurements by the same authors but significantly lower (∼25\%) than the recommended value from a decade ago by Grevesse \& Sauval. We compare the results of our models with determinations of the solar structure inferred through helioseismology measurements. The model that uses the most recent solar abundance determinations predicts the base of the solar convective envelope to be located at RCZ = 0.724 R☉ and a surface helium mass fraction of Ysurf = 0.231. These results are in conflict with helioseismology data (RCZ = 0.713 ± 0.001 R☉ and Ysurf = 0.2485 ± 0.0035) at 5σ and 11σ levels, respectively. Using the new solar abundances, we calculate the magnitude by which radiative opacities should be modified in order to restore agreement with helioseismology. We find that a maximum change of ∼15\% at the base of the convective zone is required with a smooth decrease toward the core, where the change needed is ∼5\%. The required change at the base of the convective envelope is about half the value estimated previously. We also present the solar neutrino fluxes predicted by the new models. The most important changes brought about by the new solar abundances are the increase by ∼10\% in the predicted 13N and 15O fluxes that arise mostly due to the increase in the C and N abundances in the newly determined solar composition.},

  abstract = {Context. Rotation period measurements of low-mass stars show that the spin distributions in young clusters do not exhibit the spin-up expected due to contraction in the phase when a large fraction of stars is still surrounded by accretion discs. Many physical models have been developed to explain this feature based on different types of star-disc interactions alone. In this phase, the stars accrete mass and angular momentum and may experience accretion-enhanced magnetised winds. The stellar structure and angular momentum content thus strongly depend on the properties of the accretion mechanism. At the same time, the accretion of mass and energy has a significant impact on the evolution of the stellar structure and the moment of inertia. Our understanding of the spin rates of young stars therefore requires a description of how accretion affects the stellar structure and angular momentum simultaneously. Aims: We aim to understand the role of accretion to explain the observed rotation-rate distributions of forming stars. Methods: We computed evolution models of accreting very young stars and determined in a self-consistent way the effect of accretion on stellar structure and the angular momentum exchanges between the stars and their disc. We then varied the deuterium content, the accretion history, the entropy content of the accreted material, and the magnetic field as well as the efficiency of the accretion-enhanced winds. Results: The models are driven alternatively both by the evolution of the momentum of inertia and by the star-disc interaction torques. Of all the parameters we tested, the magnetic field strength, the accretion history, and the deuterium content have the largest impact. The injection of heat plays a major role only early in the evolution. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the importance of the moment of inertia evolution under the influence of accretion for explaining the constant rotation-rate distributions that are observed during the star-disc interactions. When we account for rotation, the models computed with the recently calculated torque along with a consistent structural evolution of the accreting star are able to explain the almost constant spin evolution for the whole range of parameters we investigated, but it only reproduces a narrow range around the median of the observed spin rate distributions. Further development, including for example more realistic accretion histories based on dedicated disc simulations, are likely needed to reproduce the extremes of the spin rate distributions.},

  abstract = {Accretion through circumstellar disks plays an important role in star formation and in establishing the properties of the regions in which planets form and migrate. The mechanisms by which protostellar and protoplanetary disks accrete onto low-mass stars are not clear; angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is thought to be involved, but the low-ionization conditions in major regions of protoplanetary disks lead to a variety of complex nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects whose implications are not fully understood. Accretion in pre-main-sequence stars of masses ≲1M⊙ (and in at least some 2–3-M⊙ systems) is generally funneled by the stellar magnetic field, which disrupts the disk at scales typically of order a few stellar radii. Matter moving at near free-fall velocities shocks at the stellar surface; the resulting accretion luminosities from the dissipation of kinetic energy indicate that mass addition during the T Tauri phase over the typical disk lifetime ∼3 Myr is modest in terms of stellar evolution, but is comparable to total disk reservoirs as estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission (∼10−2 M⊙). Pre-main-sequence accretion is not steady, encompassing timescales ranging from approximately hours to a century, with longer-timescale variations tending to be the largest. Accretion during the protostellar phase—while the protostellar envelope is still falling onto the disk—is much less well understood, mostly because the properties of the central obscured protostar are difficult to estimate. Kinematic measurements of protostellar masses with new interfometric facilities should improve estimates of accretion rates during the earliest phases of star formation.},

  abstract = {Context. Classical T Tauri stars are variable objects on several timescales, but just a few of them have been studied in detail, with different observational techniques and over many rotational cycles to enable the analysis of the stellar and circumstellar variations on rotational timescales. Aims: We test the dynamical predictions of the magnetospheric accretion model with synoptic data of the classical T Tauri star V2129 Oph obtained over several rotational cycles. Methods: We analyze high resolution observations obtained with the HARPS, ESPaDOnS, and SMARTS spectrographs and simultaneous photometric measurements, clearly sampling four rotational cycles, and fit them with cold/hot spot models and radiative transfer models of emission lines. Results: The photometric variability and the radial velocity variations in the photospheric lines can be explained by the rotational modulation due to cold spots, while the radial velocity variations of the He i (5876 Å) line and the veiling variability are due to hot spot rotational modulation. The hot and cold spots are located at high latitudes and about the same phase, but the hot spot is expected to sit at the chromospheric level, while the cold spot is at the photospheric level. The mass-accretion rate of the system is stable overall around (1.5 ± 0.6) × 10-9 M⊙ yr-1, but can increase by three times this value in a rotational cycle, during an accretion burst. The Hα and Hβ emission-line profiles vary substantially and are well-reproduced by radiative transfer models calculated from the funnel flow structure of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using the dipole+octupole magnetic-field configuration previously proposed for the system. Our diskwind models do not provide a significant contribution to the emission or absorption Hα line profile of V2129 Oph. Conclusions: The global scenario proposed by magnetospheric accretion for classical T Tauri stars is able to reproduce the spectroscopic and photometric variability observed in V2129 Oph. This work uses observations made with the HARPS instrument at the 3.6-m ESO telescope (La Silla, Chile) in the framework of the LP182.D-0356.},

  abstract = {We report on a systematic search for X-ray emission from pre-main sequence and young main sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga-Perseus region. Our stellar sample consists of all T Tauri stars from the Taurus-Auriga region, and all late-type stars from the Pleiades and Hyades clusters which have been observed by the ROSAT PSPC in pointed observations. We present the X-ray parameters for all observed stars in tables. Next to the basic results of the data analysis (such as count rates, exposure time, and off-axis angle) we give X-ray luminosities and hardness ratios for all detected stars. Upper limits are given for non-detections. Detection rates for different spectral types are compiled. We use these results to study the connection between coronal X-ray activity and stellar parameters for different subgroups of our sample. In particular we compile X-ray luminosity functions (XLF), and discuss the relations between X-ray emission and spectral type, age, and rotation, which have been disputed extensively in the past. Here, we study these questions with the largest sample so far. The XLF for classical and weak-line T Tauri stars are different, with weak-lines being the stronger X-ray emitters. Proceeding towards the main-sequence (Pleiades, Hyades) the X-ray luminosity declines for all spectral types examined (G, K, and M stars). Within an age group Lx decreases towards later spectral types, while Lx/Lbol remains constant or even increases, reflecting the opposed influence of stellar radius, i.e. emitting area, and convection zone depth. For a given spectral type the fastest rotators show the highest X-ray luminosity. Rotation rate and X-ray emission are clearly correlated for all groups of stars with power law indices for log(Lx/Lbol) versus lg\{Prot\} of \textasciitilde{} -0.7 to -1.5. The study of XLF for binary stars shows that the known unresolved secondaries likely contribute a significant amount to the X-ray emission.

  abstract = {We calculate numerically the structure and evolution of pre-main-sequence stars with masses from 1 to 6 Msun. These stars are assumed to originate from protostars accreting within molecular clouds. For masses from 2 to 4 Msun, the stellar luminosity first increases markedly during a protracted epoch of nonhomologous contraction and thermal relaxation. Deuterium burns in a subsurface shell throughout this period. More massive objects are thermally relaxed from the start; they contract homologously, with fully radiative interiors. Stars with masses greater then 8 Msun have no pre-main-sequence phase, since they are already burning hydrogen by the time protostellar accretion has ended. We summarize our results by presenting a new set of evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram. Our calculations imply that Herbig Ae and Be stars are substantially younger than previously believed. The upper boundary to their distribution in the H-R diagram is well matched by our theoretical birthline. The presence in these stars of emission lines and strong winds is not linked to an outer convection zone, since our models show that such convection always vanishes with rising effective temperature. Finally, while residual accretion from circumstellar disks may be occurring, we argue that the associated mass transfer rates are not high enough to account for the stars' observed infrared excesses.},

  abstract = {Numerical calculations of the dynamics of a spherically symmetric collapsing proto-star of one solar mass have been made for various initial conditions. Calculations have also been made for masses of 2M0 and M o. In all cases the collapse is found to be extremely non-homologous and is such that a very small part of the cloud's mass at the centre reaches stellar densities and stops collapsing before most of the cloud has had time to collapse very far. The stellar core thus formed subsequently grows in mass as material falls into it, finally becoming an ordinary star when all of the proto-stellar material has been accreted. During most of this time the stellar core is completely obscured by the dust in the infalling cloud, the absorbed radiation reappearing in the infra-red as thermal emission from the dust grains. The resulting star is almost a conventional Hayashi pre-main sequence model, but it appears rather low on the Hayashi track. For masses much greater than about 2M0 the convective Hayashi phase does not exist at all. It appears that certain properties of T Tauri stars may find explanation in the results of the present calculations. In an appendix to the paper it is shown that limiting forms may be derived for the density and velocity distributions near the centre of an isothermally collapsing sphere. This may be shown to be possible also for a sphere with a polytropic equation of state. Numerical results are presented for the limiting solution in the isothermal case.},

An evolution including short episodes of vigorous accretion (\textbackslash dot\{M\}≥ 10\textasciicircum\{-4\} M\_⊙ yr\textasciicircum\{-1\}) followed by longer quiescent phases (\textbackslash dot\{M\}{$<$} 10\textasciicircum\{-6\} M\_⊙ yr\textasciicircum\{-1\}) can explain the observed luminosity spread in H-R diagrams of star-forming regions at ages of a few Myr, for objects ranging from a few Jupiter masses to a few tenths of a solar mass. The gravitational contraction of these accreting objects strongly departs from the standard Hayashi track at constant T eff. The best agreement with the observed luminosity scatter is obtained if most of the accretion shock energy is radiated away. The obtained luminosity spread at 1 Myr in the H-R diagram is equivalent to what can be misinterpreted as an \textasciitilde 10 Myr age spread for non-accreting objects. We also predict a significant spread in radius at a given T eff, as suggested by recent observations. These calculations bear important consequences for our understanding of star formation and early stages of evolution and on the determination of the initial mass function for young ({$<$}= a few Myr) clusters. Our results also show that the concept of a stellar birthline for low-mass objects has no valid support.},

  abstract = {The idea that non-steady accretion during the embedded phase of protostar evolution can produce the observed luminosity spread in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) of young clusters has recently been called into question. Observations of FU Ori, for instance, suggest an expansion of the star during strong accretion events, whereas the luminosity spread implies a contraction of the accreting objects, decreasing their radiating surface. In this paper, we present a global scenario based on calculations coupling episodic accretion histories derived from numerical simulations of collapsing cloud prestellar cores of various masses and subsequent protostar evolution. Our calculations show that, assuming an initial protostar mass Mi \textasciitilde{} 1 M Jup, typical of the second Larson's core, both the luminosity spread in the HRD and the inferred properties of FU Ori events (mass, radius, accretion rate) can be explained by this scenario, providing two conditions. First, there must be some variation within the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the protostar during the accretion process. Second, the range of this variation should increase with increasing accretion burst intensity and thus with the initial core mass and final star mass. The numerical hydrodynamics simulations of collapsing cloud prestellar cores indeed show that the intensity of the accretion bursts correlates with the mass and initial angular momentum of the prestellar core. Massive prestellar cores with high initial angular momentum are found to produce intense bursts characteristic of FU Ori-like events. Our results thus suggest a link between the burst intensities and the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the protostar, with some threshold in the accretion rate, of the order of 10-5 M ⊙ yr-1, delimitating the transition from "cold" to "hot" accretion. Such a transition might reflect a change in the accretion geometry with increasing accretion rate, i.e., a transition from magnetospheric or thin-disk to thick-disk accretion, or in the magnetospheric interaction between the star and the disk. Conversely, the luminosity spread can also be explained by a variation of the initial protostar mass within the \textasciitilde 1-5 M Jup range, although it is unclear for now whether such a spread among the second Larson's core can be produced during the prestellar core second collapse. This unified picture confirms the idea that early accretion during protostar and proto-brown dwarf formation/evolution can explain the observed luminosity spread in young clusters without invoking any significant age spread, and that the concept of a well-defined birthline does not apply for low-mass objects. Finally, we examine the impact of accretion on the determination of the initial mass function in young clusters.},

  abstract = {We revisit the problem of low-mass pre-main-sequence stellar evolution and its observational consequences for where stars fall on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). In contrast to most previous work, our models follow stars as they grow from small masses via accretion, and we perform a systematic study of how the stars' HRD evolution is influenced by their initial radius, by the radiative properties of the accretion flow, and by the accretion history, using both simple idealized accretion histories and histories taken from numerical simulations of star cluster formation. We compare our numerical results to both non-accreting isochrones and to the positions of observed stars in the HRD, with a goal of determining whether both the absolute ages and the age dispersions inferred from non-accreting isochrones are reliable. We show that non-accreting isochrones can sometimes overestimate stellar ages for more massive stars (those with effective temperatures above \textasciitilde 3500 K), thereby explaining why non-accreting isochrones often suggest a systematic age difference between more and less massive stars in the same cluster. However, we also find the only way to produce a similar overestimate for the ages of cooler stars is if these stars grow from \textasciitilde 0.01 M sun seed protostars that are an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by current theoretical models, and if the size of the seed protostar correlates systematically with the final stellar mass at the end of accretion. We therefore conclude that, unless both of these conditions are met, inferred ages and age spreads for cool stars are reliable, at least to the extent that the observed bolometric luminosities and temperatures are accurate. Finally, we note that the time dependence of the mass accretion rate has remarkably little effect on low-mass stars' evolution on the HRD, and that such time dependence may be neglected for all stars except those with effective temperatures above \textasciitilde 4000 K.},

  abstract = {In protoplanetary disks, the growth and inward drift of dust lead to the generation of a temporal “pebble wave” of increased metallicity. This phase must be followed by a phase in which the exhaustion of the pebbles in the disk and the formation of planets lead to the accretion of metal-poor gas. At the same time, disk winds may lead to the selective removal of hydrogen and helium from the disk. Hence, stars grow by accreting gas that has an evolving composition. In this work, we investigated how the formation of the Solar System may have affected the composition and structure of the Sun, and whether it plays any role in solving the so-called solar abundance problem, that is, the fact that standard models with up-to-date lower-metallicity abundances reproduce helioseismic constraints significantly more poorly than those with old higher-metallicity abundances. We simulated the evolution of the Sun from the protostellar phase to the present age and attempted to reproduce spectroscopic and helioseismic constraints. We performed chi-squared tests to optimize our input parameters, which we extended by adding secondary parameters. These additional parameters accounted for the variations in the composition of the accreted material and an increase in the opacities. We confirmed that, for realistic models, planet formation occurs when the solar convective zone is still massive; thus, the overall changes due to planet formation are too small to significantly improve the chi-square fits. We found that solar models with up-to-date abundances require an opacity increase of 12\%–18\% centered at \mkbibemph{T{$<$}i/{$>$} = 10\textsuperscript{6.4{$<$}sup/{$>$} K to reproduce the available observational constraints. This is slightly higher than, but is qualitatively in good agreement with, recent measurements of higher iron opacities. These models result in better fits to the observations than those using old abundances; therefore, they are a promising solution to the solar abundance problem. Using these improved models, we found that planet formation processes leave a small imprint in the solar core, whose metallicity is enhanced by up to 5\%. This result can be tested by accurately measuring the solar neutrino flux. In the improved models, the protosolar molecular cloud core is characterized by a primordial metallicity in the range \mkbibemph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{proto{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.0127–0.0157 and a helium mass fraction in the range \mkbibemph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{proto{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.268–0.274.}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We review the current state of our knowledge concerning the rotation and angular momentum evolution of young stellar objects and brown dwarfs from a primarily observational viewpoint. There has been a tremendous growth in the number of young, low-mass objects with measured rotation periods over the last five years, due to the application of wide field imagers on 1-2-m-class telescopes. Periods are typically accurate to 1\% and available for about 1700 stars and 30 brown dwarfs in young clusters. Discussion of angular momentum evolution also requires knowledge of stellar radii, which are poorly known for pre-main-sequence stars. It is clear that rotation rates at a given age depend strongly on mass; higher-mass stars (0.4-1.2 solar mass) have longer periods than lower-mass stars and brown dwarfs. On the other hand, specific angular momentum is approximately independent of mass for low-mass pre-main-sequence stars and young brown dwarfs. A spread of about a factor of 30 is seen at any given mass and age. The evolution of rotation of solar-like stars during the first 100 m.y. is discussed. A broad, bimodal distribution exists at the earliest observable phases (\textasciitilde 1 m.y.) for stars more massive than 0.4 solar mass. The rapid rotators (50-60\% of the sample) evolve to the ZAMS with little or no angular momentum loss. The slow rotators continue to lose substantial amounts of angular momentum for up to 5 m.y., creating the even broader bimodal distribution characteristic of 30-120-m.y.-old clusters. Accretion disk signatures are more prevalent among slowly rotating PMS stars, indicating a connection between accretion and rotation. Disks appear to influence rotation for, at most, \textasciitilde 5 m.y., and considerably less than that for the majority of stars. This time interval is comparable to the maximum lifetime of accretion disks derived from near-infrared studies, and may be a useful upper limit to the time available for forming giant planets. If the dense clusters studied so far are an accurate guide, then the typical solar-like star may have only \textasciitilde 1 m.y. for this task. There is less data available for very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs but the indication is that the same mechanisms are influencing their rotation as for the solar-like stars. However, it appears that both disk interactions and stellar winds are less efficient at braking these objects. We also review our knowledge of the various types of variability of these objects over as broad a mass range as possible with particular attention to magnetically induced cool spots and magnetically channeled variable mass accretion.},

  abstract = {Accreting magnetized stars may be in the propeller regime of disc accretion in which the angular velocity of the stellar magnetosphere exceeds that of the inner disc. In these systems, the stellar magnetosphere acts as a centrifugal barrier and plays a dominant role in the inner disc dynamics by inhibiting matter accretion on to the star. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the propeller regime using axisymmetric MHD simulations of MRI-driven accretion on to a rapidly rotating magnetized star. The disc matter is inhibited from accreting on to the star and instead accumulates at the disc–magnetosphere boundary, slowly building up a reservoir of matter. Some of this matter diffuses into the outer magnetosphere where it picks up angular momentum and is ejected as an outflow which gradually collimates at larger distances from the star. If the ejection rate is smaller than the disc's accretion rate, then the matter accumulates at the disc–magnetosphere boundary faster than it can be ejected. In this situation, accretion on to the propelling star proceeds through the episodic accretion cycle in which episodes of matter accumulation are followed by a brief episode of simultaneous ejection and accretion on to the star. In addition to the matter-dominated wind component, the propeller also drives a well-collimated, magnetically dominated Poynting jet which transports energy and angular momentum away from the star. The propelling stars undergo strong spin-down due to the outflow of angular momentum in the wind and jet. We measure spin-down time-scales of ∼1.2~Myr for a cTTs in the strong propeller regime of accretion. The propeller mechanism may explain some of the jets and winds observed around some T Tauri stars as well as the nature of their ejections. It may also explain some of the quasi-periodic variability observed in cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars and other magnetized stars.}

  abstract = {The rotational evolution of an accreting pre-main-sequence star is influenced by its magnetic interaction with its surrounding circumstellar disk. Using the PLUTO code, we perform 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic, axisymmetric, time-dependent simulations of star–disk interaction—with an initial dipolar magnetic field structure, and a viscous and resistive accretion disk—in order to model the three mechanisms that contribute to the net stellar torque: accretion flow, stellar wind, and magnetospheric ejections (periodic inflation and reconnection events). We investigate how changes in the stellar magnetic field strength, rotation rate, and mass accretion rate (changing the initial disk density) affect the net stellar torque. All simulations are in a net spin-up regime. We fit semi-analytic functions for the three stellar torque contributions, allowing for the prediction of the net stellar torque for our parameter regime, as well as the possibility of investigating spin evolution using 1D stellar evolution codes. The presence of an accretion disk appears to increase the efficiency of stellar torques compared to isolated stars, for cases with outflow rates much smaller than accretion rates, because the star–disk interaction opens more of the stellar magnetic flux compared to that from isolated stars. In our parameter regime, a stellar wind with a mass-loss rate of ≈1\% of the mass accretion rate is capable of extracting ≲50\% of the accreting angular momentum. These simulations suggest that achieving spin equilibrium in a representative T Tauri case within our parameter regime, e.g., BP Tau, would require a wind mass-loss rate of ≈25\% of the mass accretion rate.},

  abstract = {From observations collected with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, we report the discovery of magnetic fields at the surface of the mildly accreting classical T Tauri star (cTTS) V2129 Oph. Zeeman signatures are detected, both in photospheric lines and in the emission lines formed at the base of the accretion funnels linking the disc to the protostar, and monitored over the whole rotation cycle of V2129 Oph. We observe that rotational modulation dominates the temporal variations of both unpolarized and circularly polarized line profiles. We reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology at the surface of V2129 Oph from both sets of Zeeman signatures simultaneously. We find it to be rather complex, with a dominant octupolar component and a weak dipole of strengths 1.2 and 0.35 kG, respectively, both slightly tilted with respect to the rotation axis. The large-scale field is anchored in a pair of 2-kG unipolar radial field spots located at high latitudes and coinciding with cool dark polar spots at photospheric level. This large-scale field geometry is unusually complex compared to those of non-accreting cool active subgiants with moderate rotation rates. As an illustration, we provide a first attempt at modelling the magnetospheric topology and accretion funnels of V2129 Oph using field extrapolation. We find that the magnetosphere of V2129 Oph must extend to about 7R* to ensure that the footpoints of accretion funnels coincide with the high-latitude accretion spots on the stellar surface. It suggests that the stellar magnetic field succeeds in coupling to the accretion disc as far out as the corotation radius, and could possibly explain the slow rotation of V2129 Oph. The magnetospheric geometry we derive qualitatively reproduces the modulation of Balmer lines and produces X-ray coronal fluxes typical of those observed in cTTSs.

  abstract = {This paper analyses spectropolarimetric observations of the classical T Tauri star (CTTS) GM Aurigae collected with SPIRou, the near-infrared spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, as part of the SLS and SPICE Large Programs. We report for the first time results on the large-scale magnetic field at the surface of GM Aur using Zeeman Doppler imaging. Its large-scale magnetic field energy is almost entirely stored in an axisymmetric poloidal field, which places GM Aur close to other CTTSs with similar internal structures. A dipole of about 730 G dominates the large-scale field topology, while higher order harmonics account for less than 30 per cent of the total magnetic energy. Overall, we find that the main difference between our three reconstructed maps (corresponding to sequential epochs) comes from the evolving tilt of the magnetic dipole, likely generated by non-stationary dynamo processes operating in this largely convective star rotating with a period of about 6 d. Finally, we report a \$5.5\textbackslash sigma\$ detection of a signal in the activity-filtered radial velocity data of semi-amplitude \$110\textbackslash pm 20\$ m s\$\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$ at a period of \$8.745\textbackslash pm 0.009\$ d. If attributed to a close-in planet in the inner accretion disc of GM Aur, it would imply that this planet candidate has a minimum mass of \$1.10 \textbackslash pm 0.30\textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash mathrm\{Jup\}\$ and orbits at a distance of \$0.082 \textbackslash pm 0.002\$ au.},

  abstract = {The dynamical and radiative consequences of disk accretion onto magnetic T Tauri stars (TTS) are examined using the Ghosh and Lamb model. It is shown that a prolonged disk accretion phase is compatible with the low rotation rates measured in these stars if they possess a kilogauss strength field that disrupts the disk at a distance of a few stellar radii from the center. It is estimated that a steady state in which the net torque exerted on the star is zero can be attained on a time scale that is shorter than the age of the youngest visible TTS. Although the disk does not develop an ordinary shear boundary layer in this case, one can account for the observed UV excess and Balmer emission in terms of the shocks that form at the bottom of the high-latitude magnetic accretion columns on the stellar surface. This picture also provides a natural explanation of some of the puzzling variability properties of stars like DF Tau and RY Lup. YY Ori stars are interpreted as magnetic TTS in which the observer's line of sight is roughly parallel to an accretion column.},

  abstract = {We present high-resolution X-ray spectra of the X-ray-bright classical T Tauri star, TW Hydrae, covering the wavelength range of 1.5-25 Å. The differential emission measure derived from fluxes of temperature-sensitive emission lines shows a plasma with a sharply peaked temperature distribution, peaking at log T=6.5. Abundance anomalies are apparent, with iron very deficient relative to oxygen, while neon is enhanced relative to oxygen. Density-sensitive line ratios of Ne IX and O VII indicate densities near log ne=13. A flare with rapid (\textasciitilde 1 ks) rise time was detected during our 48 ks observation; however, based on analysis of the emission-line spectrum during quiescent and flaring states, the derived plasma parameters do not seem strongly time-dependent. The inferred plasma temperature distribution and densities are consistent with a model in which the bulk of the X-ray emission from TW Hya is generated via mass accretion from its circumstellar disk. Assuming that accretion powers the X-ray emission, our results for log ne suggest an accretion rate of \textasciitilde 10-8 Msolar yr-1.},

  abstract = {We present new radiative transfer models of magnetospheric accretion in T Tauri stars. Hydrogen and Na I line profiles were calculated, including line damping and continuum opacity for a grid of models spanning a large range of infall rates, magnetospheric geometries, and gas temperatures. We also calculated models for rotating magnetospheres and show that for typical T Tauri rotation rates, the line profiles are not significantly affected. We show that line-damping wings can produce significant high-velocity emission at Hα, and to a lesser extent in higher Balmer lines, in much better agreement with observations than previous models. We present comparisons to specific objects spanning a wide range of accretion activity and find that in most cases the models successfully reproduce the observed emission profile features. Blueshifted absorption components cannot be explained without including a wind outside of the magnetosphere, and true P Cygni Balmer line profiles in the few objects with extreme accretion activity indicate both absorption and emission from a wind. We constrain the range of gas temperatures required to explain observational diagnostics like profile shapes, line ratios, and continuum emission. The exact heating mechanism remains unclear but is probably linked to the accretion process itself. In order to explain observed correlations between line emission and accretion luminosity, we find that the size of the emitting region must be correlated with the accretion rate. We suggest that such a correlation may manifest itself in reality via nonaxisymmetric accretion, where the number and/or width of discrete funnel flows increase with increasing accretion rate, a scenario also indicated by accretion shock models.},

  abstract = {Outflows from accreting, rotating, and magnetized systems are ubiquitous. Protostellar outflows can be observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths in the continuum and a multitude of spectral lines that probe a wide range of physical conditions, chemical phases, radial velocities, and proper motions. Wide-field visual and near-IR data, mid-IR observations from space, and aperture synthesis with centimeter- and millimeterwave interferometers are revolutionizing outflow studies. Many outflows originate in multiple systems and clusters. Although most flows are bipolar and some contain highly collimated jets, others are wide-angle winds, and a few are nearly isotropic and exhibit explosive behavior. Morphologies and velocity fields indicate variations in ejection velocity, mass-loss rate, and in some cases, flow orientation and degree of collimation. These trends indicate that stellar accretion is episodic and often occurs in a complex dynamical environment. Outflow power increases with source luminosity but decreases with evolutionary stage. The youngest outflows are small and best traced by molecules such as CO, SiO, H2O, and H2. Older outflows can grow to parsec scales and are best traced by shock-excited atoms and ions such as hydrogen-recombination lines, [Sii], and [Oii]. Outflows inject momentum and energy into their surroundings and provide an important mechanism in the self-regulation of star formation. However, momentum injection rates remain uncertain with estimates providing lower bounds.},
